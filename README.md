This repository contains the analysis notebook as well as input and output files for the analysis of BGC content in phylum Cyanobacteriota (corresponding to Figure 2) in the manuscript.

The complete analysis can be seen by opening either `analysis.pdf` or `analysis.nb.html`.

The `data/` directory contains the input files used in the analysis, which were either downloaded from NCBI or from the Secondary Metabolism Collaboratory (SMC) database, which is accessible at https://smc.jgi.doe.gov/.

The `figs/` directory contains the combined Figure 2 in PDF and PNG format, as well as subdirectories containing all the figures generated in the analysis in both PDF and PNG format.

There will be dedicated "versions" tagged for the repository to mark it's state as it undergoes review, with a dedicated tag for the state of the repository when it is accepted for publication, since there may be changes/improvements both before and after paper acceptance.
