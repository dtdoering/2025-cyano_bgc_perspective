This repository contains the analysis notebook as well as input and output files for the analysis of BGC content in phylum Cynaobacteriota (corresponding to figures {X Y Z}) in the manuscript {reference}.

The input files in the `data/` directory are from the Secondary Metabolism Collaboratory (SMC) database, accessible at https://smc.jgi.doe.gov/.

There will be dedicated "versions" tagged for the repository to mark it's state as it undergoes review, with a dedicated tag for the state of the repository when it is accepted for publication, since there may be changes/improvements both before and after paper acceptance.
